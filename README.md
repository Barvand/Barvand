### Hi there 👋
I am Bart, a student of the web and Full time front end development student at Noroff Vocational School with the aim to make functional, user friendly and beautiful websites. 
 
In my spare time I like to develop my coding skills to create own projects. I also, like to be outdoors and play games as while being a dad of 2 children. 

### What am I doing? 
- 🔭 I’m currently in the second year of the Front end development programm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  
-  ⚡ Fun fact: I studied sports and was part of the Dutch military. I like gardening and building my own computers.

 Feel free to send me a DM on github for a conversation!

 Have a great day!
